REPOSITORY SYNC VERIFICATION
============================

Repository: https://github.com/rodsct/saasiav4
Commit: 79ecc7b
Timestamp: 2025-08-26T04:01:37Z

FILES THAT MUST EXIST IN EASYPANEL:
✅ Dockerfile (1141 bytes) - Main build file
✅ app.dockerfile (1141 bytes) - Alternative build file  
✅ docker-compose.yml - Main configuration
✅ docker-compose.test.yml - Alternative configuration
✅ package.json - Dependencies
✅ src/ directory - Application code
✅ prisma/ directory - Database schema

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
ls -la | grep Dockerfile
# Should show: Dockerfile and app.dockerfile

cat Dockerfile | head -1  
# Should show: FROM node:18-alpine AS base

If these files don't appear in Easypanel's build context,
there is a SYNC ISSUE that requires:
1. Complete service deletion
2. Repository disconnection  
3. Fresh repository connection
4. New service creation

ALTERNATIVE: Try different hosting platform if sync fails repeatedly.
